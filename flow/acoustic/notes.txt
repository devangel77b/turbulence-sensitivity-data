Placed Blue Microphone Snowflake in a tub of sand and placed in wind tunnel at same position as anemometer measurements.  

Measured at spd=c(0,50,100,250)
Vave=c(0.018,1.011,2.261,6.727)
Hz = c(0,5.9,11.0,29.4)

Sampling frequency 44.1 kHz, signed 32 bit floats. 

20 minute samples, should provide for 10-20 cuts down to 11 or 5 Hz.
